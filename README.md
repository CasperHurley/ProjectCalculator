API for calculating optimum materials and cost for carpentry projects.

Why use this API?
- Determine least amount of boards needed to create a DIY Project, for different stock lengths of board. For simplicity, it does not do combinations of different stock lengths (8ft, 10ft, 12ft, etc).
- Determine about how much paint or stain would be needed based on total square footage needed, compared to total square footage the stain or paint can covers.
- Might be able to loosely guesstimate how many screws/nails would be needed in the future.
- I personally use this API to play around with the lengths of lumber I need to produce, combined with the costs of stock lengths of materials I could buy, and I can play around with those lengths to determine the cheapest shopping list to get the job done.
- In my opinion, the best use of this API is the "Cut Plan" that it produces, which tells me exactly which pieces of wood to cut out of which boards, and helps prevent me from screwing up and needing to buy more wood.
